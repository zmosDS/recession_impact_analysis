    <h1>Final Project - Prototype Write-Up</h1>
    <p>We turned our initial static year-over-year (YoY) employment chart into a usable interactive visualization. The chart now snaps to the nearest year as you hover, highlights that point and displays a small set of easy to read stats. Recessions are shaded from their starting month through the two years that follow, letting viewers see both the decline and the recovery. Hovering within a recession window adds stats that show the recession name, start date and estimated job loss. Altogether, the chart moves from just showing numbers to clearly communicating the story behind each downturn.  
      <br><br>
      So far, we have downloaded the raw data from <a href=https://download.bls.gov/pub/time.series/ce/ target=”_blank”>BLS.gov</a> , filtered it from 1995-2024, and processed it into industry supersectors. Using this data we’ve built the first interactive visualization: a YoY employment chart with snapping hover, recession shading and tooltips that summarize both yearly trends and recession periods. We have also drafted our overall narrative structure (AND / BUT / THEN) to guide how each visualization will fit into the story. Finally, this initial prototype work was placed into a Github repository and deployed on Github pages.  
      <br><br>
      The most challenging part of our explorable project will be designing visuals in a way that stays simple and intuitive while comparing multiple recessions across industries. Keeping everything coherent as the story expands will take careful design. We have drafted a storyboard with corresponding visualizations/animations; however, it will be difficult to tell if the storytelling is effective until we get working prototypes of each story point. Because of this, we plan to make a basic skeleton draft of the explorable to gauge effectiveness before finalizing each visualization and polishing the design.

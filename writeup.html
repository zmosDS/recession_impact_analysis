    <h1>Final Project - Prototype Write-Up</h1>
    <p>We turned our initial static YoY employment chart into a usable interactive visualization. The chart now snaps to the nearest year as you hover, highlights that point and displays a small set of easy to read stats. Recessions are shaded from their starting month through the two years that follow, letting viewers see both the decline and the recovery. Hovering within a recession window adds stats that show the recession name, start date and estimated job loss. Altogether, the chart moves from just showing numbers to clearly communicating the story behind each downturn.  
      <br><br>
      So far, we’ve built the first interactive visualization: a YoY employment chart with snapping hover, recession shading and tooltips that summarize both yearly trends and recession periods. We also selected our overall narrative structure (AND / BUT / THEN) to guide how each visualization will fit into the story.  
      <br><br>
      The most challenging part will be designing visuals in a way that stays simple and intuitive while comparing multiple recessions across industries. Keeping everything coherent as the story expands will take careful design.

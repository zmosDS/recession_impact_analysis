      Recessions appear as sudden dips in total employment, and most readers have

    <p class="story-text">
      The recessions of 2001, 2008, and 2020 were caused by different shocks and
      produced different patterns of job loss. Some were slow burns; others were
      sudden free-falls.

    <p class="story-text">
      Your chosen industry may have collapsed in one recession, boomed through
      another, or struggled to bounce back. Its story isn’t the same as the
      overall economy’s story.

    </h2>
    <p class="story-text">
      After each recession ends, industries settle into new trajectories. Some
      reinvent themselves and grow beyond pre-recession levels; others stabilize
      lower. The shape of a recession becomes the shape of a future.
